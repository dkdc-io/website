***The last thing I want to talk about is dbt.***

Despite joining dbt Labs (the VC-backed company behind dbt) as a product manager, I still didn't quite "get" dbt as a product. My background was in data science and machine learning and while data was obviously critical, I had little experience with databases and data practitioners who largely work with databases (or warehouses). Part of my motivation in leaving to join a data startup like dbt Labs was to learn.

So what makes dbt such a fun product to use for programming novices?

## How I learned to code

Despite my name, I was unable to code until college.

## Why dbt is cool for data analysts

Data analysts working in SQL are typically novice programmers.
