Ostensibly a limited liability company (LLC) would limit my liability, but there was effectively no risk in my work. The real appeal was in learning the process and being able to say “I started a company”.\n\n“I started a company!”\n“Oh yeah? What’s it called?”\n“DKDC LLC.”\n“What does DKDC stand for?”\n“Don’t know, don’t care.”"

I strongly prefer you send your code in a GitHub pull request from a computer rather than a fax of a print out from your typerwriter. In either case, if you can’t vouch for the work you’re publishing, you’re doing it wrong.\n\nlanguage models and Python (and SQL)\nAbstractions: vim is a lot nicer than punching cards. Working with high-level programming languages is typically a lot more productive than working with assembly, though there will always be a place for programming languages at all levels of abstraction. For working with data (and machine learning), Python is a great choice and the clear winner by popularity (+ SQL)."

Of course, other open source software and Python packages are used along the way (and you can use whatever you like!).\nSome miscellaneous notes:\n\norder: the Dockefile is ordered so that frequently changing parts are toward the bottom\ncache: the big point is the caching line, which I stole from somewhere (here?)\nreadme.md: the pyproject.toml is needed as it defines the installation of the package (and CLI), and the readme.md is needed because it’s referenced in the pyproject.toml\nsrc: this is the source code, in something like src/my_package, and obviously needs to be copied\npinning verions: in general I’m not pinning (or using a uv lockfile), but I would obviously recommend doing so for production workloads and having a process for updating dependencies\nsystem installation: we use system Python instead of creating a Python virtual environment (which uv makes easy) because we’re already in a virtual container (often itself in a virtual machine)\n\nCombining this with a few justfile commands makes development and deployment very easy. The simplicity of Python and tools that cover the full stack (CLI, database, GUI) make it a great choice for rapidly prototyping scalable applications.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
